Remember to call NL::init() first of all (Expecially if you are developing for Windows OS, in linux or OSX it has no effect).

Linking the lib:

	* It works out of the box in OSX and linux systems.
	* Link against WS2_32.lib in Visual C++.


Tested in g++ 4.4.5 (linux and OSX) and VS2008 Express (windows)
